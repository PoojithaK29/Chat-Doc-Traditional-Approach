# Chat-Doc-Traditional-Approach

This project highlights expertise in traditional NLP techniques for question answering, utilizing word embeddings and vectorizers like TF-IDF, BoW, Word2Vec, and GloVe. It extracts text from PDFs and leverages TF-IDF to retrieve contextually relevant sentences based on user queries within an interactive Streamlit interface.

# Advanced NLP Question Answering with TF-IDF

## Overview

Showcasing advanced NLP skills, this project utilizes traditional techniques for question-answering, leveraging powerful vectorizers and word embeddings. By applying TF-IDF, it efficiently processes and retrieves meaningful insights from PDF content through an intuitive, query-driven interface.

## Key Components

- **Bag of Words (BoW):** Creates a word frequency matrix for basic text representation.
- **Word2Vec:** Captures semantic relationships using continuous word embeddings.
- **GloVe:** Enhances semantic understanding with pre-trained word vectors.
- **TF-IDF:** Assigns importance to words for effective information retrieval.

## Features

- PDF text extraction.
- Robust sentence tokenization using NLTKâ€™s `punkt`.
- Precision-driven TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for accurate sentence retrieval.
- Engaging messenger-style UI crafted with Streamlit, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

This project encapsulates a deep understanding of traditional NLP methods, bridging fundamental techniques with practical applications.
